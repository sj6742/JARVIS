# J.A.R.V.I.S - AI Virtual Assistant

J.A.R.V.I.S (**Just A Rather Very Intelligent System**) is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to automate tasks and enhance user productivity. Built using **Python**, it integrates **speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning** to execute voice commands efficiently.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition & Synthesis** – Listens and responds to voice commands.
- **Web Scraping & Online Search** – Fetches real-time data like news and weather.
- **Task Automation** – Opens applications, manages files, and sets reminders.
- **Email & Messaging** – Sends emails and messages using voice commands.
- **Media Control** – Plays music, opens videos, and controls volume.
- **Smart Home Integration** – Connects with IoT devices for home automation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **SpeechRecognition**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **API Integrations (Google, Wikipedia, Weather API, etc.)**
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) - pyttsx3**

## Installation
